# MERN-Project

To start the React frontend, navigate to the frontend directory in the terminal and run the command `npm install` to install all the required packages. After the installation is complete, run the command npm start to start the frontend server on the default port 3000.

To start the NodeJS backend, navigate to the backend directory in the terminal and run the command `npm install` to install all the required packages. After the installation is complete, run the command npm start to start the backend server on the default port 5000.

Before running the backend server, make sure to create a .env file in the root directory of the backend and add the following credentials for MongoDB:

MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
Replace <your-mongodb-uri> with your own MongoDB credentials by creating a .env file

Note: It is not recommended to upload your credentials to a public repository, as this could compromise the security of your database. Instead, use a .env file and add it to your .gitignore file to keep it private.
